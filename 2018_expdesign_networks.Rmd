# Introduction

## Interference: When people have friends

* Observational units are connected -- so far, we've been dealing with causal
  analyses _in a vacuum_.

* Sometimes, it's reasonable to assume that units do not affect one another;
  often, it's not.

* A central assumption in causal models, necessary for identification results,
  is the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption [@rubin1978bayesian] &
  [@rubin1980randomization].

* _Interference_ is often defined through the loosening of this assumption
  [@hudgens2008toward].

## Networks: Are you (still) on facebook too?

* In a population of causally connected units, several types of network
  structures may arise, each posing unique challenges for statistics.

* Broadly, the central statistical challenge is _"how to account for the
  presence of connections, or network data, observed pre-intervention, possibly
  with uncertainty, and often missing"_ @basse2018+model.

## Networks: Two perspectives

* Two main problem settings have been discussed in the causal inference
  literature
  1. _Network interference_: When the potential outcomes of a given unit are a
     function of its assigned treatment and that of others.
  2. _Network-correlated outcomes_: When the potential outcomes of units in a
     network are related through their baseline covariates.

* The first problem has been the subject of much attention in the literature, so
  @basse2018+model focus on resolving issues in the second setting.

## Network-correlated outcomes: We're not _that_ different

* Most often studied in the context of observational studies.

* @basse2018+model focus on

## Goals and Motivation

* _The problem_: "how to assign treatment in a randomized experiment, when the
  correlation among the outcomes is informed by a network available at the
  design stage."

* Identify and estimate the causal effect of interference in the presence of
  confounding induced by correlated outcomes.

* How can information about a network be used to inform randomization strategies
  for estimating causal effects?

## Approach

* Use _model-assisted restricted randomization strategies_, leveraging a static
  network known pre-intervention.

* Restricted randomization has a long history in experimental design --
  @basse2018+model build off of this, using strategies that balance covariates
  properly.

## Approach

* Posit a working model for the potential outcomes, conditional on the network
  known pre-intervention.

* Restrict the set of allowed randomization strategies such that the estimator
  of interest achieves low MSE.

* In turn, focus on MSE suggests new notions of balance in network-based
  randomization (related to network degree statistics).

## Findings

* Proposed approach maintains design unbiasedness of the difference-in-means
  estimator, even when the working model is misspecified (i.e., robustness).

* When the working model is correct, inference is improved through higher
  precision of the estimator of interest.

## Notation

* $N$ observational units, indexed $i = 1, \ldots, n$.

* Binary treatment $Z$, where $Z_i = 1$ denotes assignment to treatment arm.

* Real-valued outcome $Y_i$, with potential outcomes $Y_i(Z_i)$:
  * $Y_i(1)$ for $Z_i = 1$ and
  * $Y_i(0)$ for $Z_i = 0$.

## Assumptions

* _Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption_ [@rubin1974estimating] &
  [@rubin1978bayesian].
  * i.e., $Y_i(Z) = Y_i(Z_i)$
  * explicitly disallows network interference

* Finite population setting: recall that potential outcomes $Y(Z)$ are unknown
  but constant quantities, given $Z$.

* _Randomized experiment_: only source of variation is the allocation of
  treatment to units (controlled by experimenter).

* Treatment allocated based on distribution on the space of all binary vectors
  of length $N$, i.e., randomization distribution [@imbens2015causal].

## Parameter of interest: ATE

* For illustration, focus on ATE as the inferential target.

* With the notation previously given, the ATE is defined as
  $$ \tau^* = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^N \{Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\}$$

* Focus also on the difference-in-means estimator for the ATE:
  $$\hat{\tau}(Y \mid Z) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^N Z_i Y_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^N Z_i} -
    \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^N (1 - Z_i) Y_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^N (1 - Z_i)}$$

## An undirected network

* The proposed methodology requires that a network be known at the design stage
  (pre-specified).

* Let the network be an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}$ over $N$ units, where
   * $\mathcal{G}$ is simply an $N \times N$ binary adjacency matrix $A$, where
     all diagonal entries are unary (i.e., $A_{ii} = 1$), and
   * the neighborhood of unit $i$ be the index set
     $\mathcal{N}_i = \{j: A_{ij} = 1 \}$.

## A simplified model

* For illustrative purposes, assume the _normal-sum model_:
  \begin{align*}
    X_j & \sim_{iid} N(\mu, \sigma^2) \\
    Y_i(0) \mid X & \sim_{ind} N(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} X_j, \gamma^2) \\
    Y_i(1) & = Y_i(0) + \tau
  \end{align*}

* Observations in the same group are taken to have originated from a Normal
  distribution with the same mean.

* "The network induces correlation among the outcomes that are assigned to
  control because the mean of each $Y_i(0)$ is given by the sum of the
  covariate values $X_j$ of units $j$ in a neighborhood of $i$".

## A simplified model

* Constant treatment effect model: $\tau$ is the difference between the
  potential outcomes $\{Y_i(0), Y_i(1)\}$.

* _Intuition_: in the absence of network connections and treatment $Z_i = 0$:
  * $Y_i(0)$ is a measure of an intrinsic property of the observational unit
    (e.g., time spent on social media), as determined by covariates $X$.
  * Network connections alter the natural value $Y_i(0)$ that would occur,
    through the induced network structure.
  * The intervention $\text{do}(Z_i = 1)$ induces a causal effect $\tau$ such
    that $Y_i(1) = Y_i(0) + \tau$.

* The _normal-sum_ model is just a starting point...

## Optimal treatment allocation

* To ascertain an optimal treatment allocation strategy, need a notion of error
  to define optimality.

* @basse2018+model propose the _conditional MSE_:
  1. fix a treatment allocation vector $Z$, then
  2. for the _normal-sum model_, $\text{MSE}(\hat{\tau} \mid Z) \equiv
     \mathbb{E}\{(\hat{\tau} - \tau^*)^2 \mid Z \}$

* Now, an optimal treatment allocation $Z^* \in \mathcal{Z}$ is one that
  minimizes the conditional MSE.

## Where are the networks?

* A decomposition of the conditional MSE is informative of network statistics:
  \begin{equation*}
    \text{MSE}(\hat{\tau} \mid Z) = \mu^2 \{\delta_N(Z) \}^2 +
      \gamma^2 \omega(Z)^T \omega(Z) + \sigma^2 \omega(Z)^T A^T A \omega(Z)
  \end{equation*}

* Each of the terms in the MSE decomposition is informative
  * $\text{Bias}^2$: $\mu^2 \{\delta_N(Z) \}^2$
  * _Network-agnostic_ variance component: $\gamma^2 \omega(Z)^T \omega(Z)$
  * _Network-aware_ variance component: $\sigma^2 \omega(Z)^T A^T A \omega(Z)$

* Model-assisted restriction randomization strategies seek to minimize the
  conditional MSE, but tradeoffs occur in these components.

## Bias

* The bias term admits the decomposition
  \begin{equation*}
    \mu \cdot \delta_{\mathcal{N}} = \mu \cdot \left( \frac{1}{N_1}
    \sum_{(i:Z_i = 1)} \lvert \mathcal{N}_i \rvert - \frac{1}{N_0}
    \sum_{(i:Z_i = 0)} \lvert \mathcal{N}_i \rvert \right)
  \end{equation*}

* The bias is proportional to the _average degree_ of each of the experimental
  arms (treatment and control groups).

* This is the difference in the average neighborhood sizes of the treated and
  untreated units -- i.e., balance!

* Desirable treatment allocation vectors $\mathcal{Z}^b$ will minimize this
  difference in neighborhood sizes.

## Network-agnostic variance term

* The first part of the variance term may be decomposed
  \begin{equation*}
    \gamma^2 \omega^T \omega = \gamma^2 \left(\frac{1}{N_1} + \frac{1}{N_0}
    \right)
  \end{equation*}

* Similar to the previous term, this term is minimized when $N_1 = N_0$.

* Thus, this term penalizes a difference in the size of treatment and control
  units, and is satisfied through _balance_.

* This is similar to prior work in balanced randomizations outside of the
  context of network-correlated outcomes.

## Network-aware variance term

* The second part of the variance term may be written
  \begin{align*}
    \sigma^2 \cdot \omega^T A^T A \omega =& \frac{\sigma^2}{N_1^2} \cdot
      \sum_{i,j: Z_i = Z_j = 1} \lvert \mathcal{N}_i \cap \mathcal{N}_j
      \rvert \\
    +& \frac{\sigma^2}{N_0^2} \cdot \sum_{i,j: Z_i = Z_j = 0} \lvert
      \mathcal{N}_i \cap \mathcal{N}_j \rvert \\
    -& \frac{2\sigma^2}{N_1 \cdot N_0} \cdot \sum_{i,j: Z_i = 1 \text{and}
      Z_j = 0} \lvert \mathcal{N}_i \cap \mathcal{N}_j \rvert
  \end{align*}

* Minimize contribution of this term to the MSE by
  1. assigning units with shared neighbors to different groups, and
  2. avoiding assigning treatment or control to clusters of densely connected
     units.

## Towards generalized network models

* The _normal-sum model_ we discussed is just a simple case of a much broader
  family of models
  \begin{equation*}
    Y_i(0) \mid X \sim^{ind} N(g[\{X_j\}_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i}], \gamma^2)
  \end{equation*}

* Need regularity conditions on $g$ to ensure that $\mathbb{E}(g[\{X_j\}_{j \in
  \mathcal{N}_i}] \mid \{X_j\}_{j \in \mathcal{S}})$ is well-behaved for any
  subset of nodes $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{N}_i$.

## Lessons for good designs

* Decrease the number of neighbors shared within treatment groups.

* Increase the number of units shared between treatment groups.

* Balance the size of the groups and the distribution of neighborhood sizes.
